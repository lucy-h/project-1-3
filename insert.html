<!-- Template for the add/insert page
	
	There should be one of these for each kind of entity.
	Make sure that the forms can capture relationships. For example, if this is a "New Program" page, you might want to have a get request to get all the staff members, and let the user select the program organizer from a dropdown menu. You don't have to code in the get request yet, but make sure you have the front end for something like that.

	Notice that the "Add" button calls the addRequest() function in the main.js javascript. The addRequest function shoudld take data from the form and send a put request to a URL of the following form:
		../add.php?type=staff&name=lucy&phonenum=9178337518... 
	So that it's consistent I think we should use the exact attribute names from our proprosal:

	But take out all the '_' so that phone_num becomes phonenum, for example.
