<!-- Main page should have links to subpages where user can:
	- add/search staff (including RAs and CAs)
	- add/search expenses
	- add/search programs
	- add/search budgets
	- add/search residence halls
	Each of the add/search pages might have links to other pages. For example, when the user gets results with staff data, there might be links to the staff's budget.

This was our original proposal:
The standard task flow of our application would begin when one or more RA/CA proposes a program to their GHD. If the program is approved:
1) the GHD would input program details into a form in our web interface
2) if there are expense form number(s) included in the program details, then expense forms with those numbers were given out to fund that program
3) after expense forms are used, the GHD would input additional details about that expense form (e.g. amount spent, vendor)
4) given that staff member and budget details have already been added into the database, appropriate budgets would update each time an expense is logged (this is done in the backend)
5) Note that expense forms can also be given out independent from a program.
6) In addition to the web interface that allows the user to input initial residence hall, staff and budget data as well as add and update expenses, there is also a search page that allows expenses to be searched and organized by various search criteria.
